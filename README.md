# OpenCV-Random-Shape-Generator
This module creates randomly three geometric shapes, namely circles, rectangles, and triangles. All the parameters of these shapes are selected randomly by the algorithm. This code initially was developed to generate shapes used for training a Keras-RetinaNet. Therefore, its also saves the position of the shapes as well as the size and label. The required information, including labels and names of images, is stored in a .csv file.
